# MACSS Grant LLM Filter

This project uses GPT4 to read though grant texts and filter out grants that do
not meet the required criteria. For grants that do meet criteria, it produces 
a summary of the grant and sends it as an email for human review.

If you have mamba installed on your machine, you can use the following bash script to install the environment.
```
$ bash install_env.sh
```
