# General Research Notes

## Aggregators
[Pivot](https://pivot.proquest.com/dashboard)

UChicago has a subscription to the system, so free. It's a general aggregator, so includes NSF, NIH, other gov grants and private grants. 

- Deceptively specific search functionality, meaning it has many seach fields, boolean logic, dozens of subcategories, but they essentially don't work. You'll specify certain things and they don't come up and things that shouldn't come up do.
- You can setup a saved recurring search logic that will send any new grants as an email.
  - The saved search runs once weekly, Monday. Non-editable
  - The saved search goes to the registrant email. AKA your uchicago.edu address. Also non-editable.

[Grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov/)

Grants.gov is the U.S. government's online portal that provides access to information about federal grant programs. It's managed by the Department of Health and Human Services and it's used by federal agencies to post discretionary funding opportunities and for grantees to find and apply to them.

- Actually unusable. I was unable to test this aggregator because the registration process orphaned my useurname and wouldn't let me register a different account with same recovery phone number. I literally can't sign in to test it. 

[GrantForward](https://www.grantforward.com/index)

General purpose aggregator. UChicago does not have a contract and free trial registers for UChicago the organization. Also untestable.

Actual text of the free trail request.

> I certify that I can represent my institution for considering a GrantForward subscription, and I agree to provide feedback after taking a free trial.

Also non-transparent pricing.

> Price is determined by your institution size-- in terms of both total population and annual research expenditures. Please contact support@grantforward.com for detailed subscription plans and pricing.
